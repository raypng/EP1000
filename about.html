<h2>Who am i</h2>
<p>Hi i am raymond from singapore polytechnic, year 2, taking a course in diploma in engineering with business.<br>In my course we learn from 3 schools, electronic, mechanical and business. some things that i like about my course is that we have the chance to earn form 3 schools and that is just a part of what i like we also got hands on module such as EDS(electronic design solution,which we get to try hands on work in class.</p>
<h2>why i took this elective module(digital fabrication)</h2>
<p>i took this elective module because it will enable me to experience making a prototype and learning the skills of being able to use the tools that are in the fablab, it can also allow me pick up skills which i can use in my diploma.<br>In this course i can also used the skills that i have learnt before and try to make use of them in this module to make me work more efficiently.<br>This module also enables sudents to engage their creativity in making their product, which will enable me to be more creative in my course in some modules such as, Microcontroller application, that needs me to come up with a prototype to solve our problem statement.</p>
