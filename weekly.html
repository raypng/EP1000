			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td ><b>fusion 360</td>
			<td ><i>i choose this because we had no other choice of cad programme to use, the lecturer also recommended this and i have this programme in my laptop beforehand already  and have some experience using it.</i>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td ><b>chrome </td>
			<td ><i>since i already have it pre installed in my laptop and i frequently use it making it more familiar and easier for me to work with chrome.</i>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td ><b>sublime text</td>
			<td ><i>because the lecturer said that he would be using sublime text in class, so i thought since he was going to use it, it would be easier to follow since we are using the same text editor </i></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td ><b>librecad</td>
			<td ><i> because it seems like cad which i as an engineering student had experience using it before so it would be easier</i>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td ><b>gimp</td>
			<td ><i>because it is the only application that was shown to me during lessons and the lecturer strongly recommend using this programme</i>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td ><b>picpick</td>
			<td ><i>because in the slides it shows that this is for windows and the lecturer did mention that this is very easy and versatile to use hence i should have any problems using it</i>
