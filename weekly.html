<table class="tg">
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th ><h3>programme </th>
				<th ><h3>reasons</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
		<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td ><b>photo resizer</td>
			<td ><i>photo resizer:this was the only option given to me in the slides so i decided to use this </i>	
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td ><b>fusion 360</td>
			<td ><i>i choose this because we had no other choice of cad programme to use, the lecturer also recommended this and i have this programme in my laptop beforehand already  and have some experience using it.</i>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td ><b>chrome </td>
			<td ><i>since i already have it pre installed in my laptop and i frequently use it making it more familiar and easier for me to work with chrome.</i>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td ><b>sublime text</td>
			<td ><i>because the lecturer said that he would be using sublime text in class, so i thought since he was going to use it, it would be easier to follow since we are using the same text editor </i></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td ><b>librecad</td>
			<td ><i> because it seems like cad which i as an engineering student had experience using it before so it would be easier</i>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td ><b>gimp</td>
			<td ><i>because it is the only application that was shown to me during lessons and the lecturer strongly recommend using this programme</i>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td ><b>picpick</td>
			<td ><i>because in the slides it shows that this is for windows and the lecturer did mention that this is very easy and versatile to use hence i should have any problems using it</i>

<h2 style="text-align: center">second week</h2>
<p>this week, the lecturer taught the class some basic html and told us to go home and try it out and also write 2 paragraph in our website.so this is just the start of me wrtitng up the 2 paragraph. during lesson the basic of html was enough to just write up content but the lecturer said that we should not use html to do our design for the website instead we should use css so we have not started doing anything fancy for our webpage instead we just wrote our content.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center">third week</h2>
<p>we are going to learn how to put our website online on github with the help of our lecturer and also have to complete our website before assesment, with the help of css we also did some basic design on our webpage even though my webpage is not very nice. our lecturer also told us to go back and watch some video on gimp and inkscape on how to use it.

<h2 style="text-align: center">forth week</h2>
<p>this week, we used fusion 360 to practice and get a feel of using the program this pictures below are some examples of what i had did during lecturers,on friday the lecturer gave us some tips and more insight on fusion 360 about the software and tools that are available in the programme for us to design what we want. we also did some practices on fusion 360 we design a keychain, with the username of my github. which we will be printing in week 5 and we also did a design on a lego brick with the help of a youtube video(credits to kevin kennedy's video)</p>
<p>this is a practice on the work i have done on monday<br><img src="images/Image 1.png" alt="practice" style="width: 360px" /></p>
