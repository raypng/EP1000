<h2 style="text-align: center">second week</h2>
<div id="w2">
<p>this week, the lecturer taught the class some basic html and told us to go home and try it out and also write 2 paragraph in our website.so this is just the start of me wrtitng up the 2 paragraph. <br>during lesson the basic of html was enough to just write up content but the lecturer said that we should not use html to do our design for the website instead we should use css so we have not started doing anything fancy for our webpage instead we just wrote our content.</p></div>


<h2 style="text-align: center">third week</h2>
<div id ="w3">
<p>we are going to learn how to put our website online on github with the help of our lecturer and also have to complete our website before assesment, with the help of css we also did some basic design on our webpage even though my webpage is not very nice. <br>our lecturer also told us to go back and watch some video on gimp and inkscape on how to use it.</div>

<div id="sub1"><h3>This are some pictures of how we did it</h3></div><br><img src="images/Image 4.png" alt="start" style="width: 360px" /><br><img src="images/Image 2.png" alt="page" style="width: 360px" />

<div id ="sub2">
	<br>he also told us about git to help us do our work offline so that we can punlish it online but instead we used another programme which is github desktop.</div> 

<div id="sub1"><h3>This is a picture of git</h3></div><img src="images/Image 3.png" alt="git" style="width: 360px" /><br>but this is a picture of were i got github desktop<br><img src="images/github.png" alt="github" style="width: 360px" /></p>

<div id ="w4">
<p>this week, we used fusion 360 to practice and get a feel of using the program this pictures below are some examples of what i had did during lecturers,on friday the lecturer gave us some tips and more insight on fusion 360 about the software and tools that are available in the programme for us to design what we want. <br>we also did some practices on fusion 360 we design a keychain, with the username of my github. <br>which we will be printing in week 5 and we also did a design on a lego brick with the help of a youtube video(credits to kevin kennedy's video)</p></div>
<div id="e3"><h3>this is a practice on the work i have done on monday, i will upload the download link soon</h3></div><br><img src="images/Image 1.png" alt="practice" style="width: 360px" /></p>

<div id ="w5">
<p>this week we are still doing fusion 360 but we learned new functions to make our design process easier, some of the funtions we learn are revolve,etc. <br>our lecturer also went through excercise 3 of last week work on practicing to draw on fusion 360. <br>before this friday i also have done my work of completing the new fusion 360 excercises provided in the notes, i also have done the chess piece which we will be printing when we go back to school, when school reopens. i have also done a nut in the excercise with the help of a youtube by kevin's kennedy.</p></div>
